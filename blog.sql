Even the rain is sweet in the summertime. Long drives to the seaside and a sense of spontaneity that only can exist during summer. I never want you to end. \r\n\r\nWith the sun shining outside and the temperatures skyrocketing, it&rsquo;s time to enjoy the longer day hour. Unless you&rsquo;re in a dark gothic mood and can&rsquo;t wait for the darkness, Summer is the time to venture out and try different experiences. On that note, not all summers are built the same and despite the sunshine, there are one or a few summer aesthetics that will resonate more with your lifestyle. And it matters because it can help you plan your vacations and your budget and turn it into a much more fulfilling experience for your soul than just going with the flow. So, this is a visual post, with inspiring images of different summer aesthetics. My goal? That you feel naturally connected to the summer aesthetic that speaks to your soul.\r\n\r\n', '1675604472Summer-Moodboard.jpg', '2023-02-05 13:36:20', 3, 30, 0),

Whenever you want to start a study session, you plant a tree in your in-app &ldquo;forest&rdquo;. As you work, the tree will begin to grow, but if you pick up your phone and leave the app, your tree dies! You can collect and add more trees to your forest the more you focus. The company even plants real trees in dozens of countries! It&rsquo;s a win-win situation for you and the Earth.   ||\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n|| Tide ||\r\niOS, Android, Chrome extension || Free\r\n\r\nMy personal favourite focus app, Tide, is the perfect fusion of productivity, wellness, and beautiful design. The app allows you to set up personalized Pomodoro-focus sessions, with a wide variety of nature sounds, white noise, and calm music. If you leave the app, you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;fail&rdquo; the focus session! The app also features sleep, nap, meditation, and beautiful daily quotes to keep you motivated.\r\n    ||\r\n\r\n\r\n|| Motion ||\r\nChrome extension || Paid with free trial available\r\n\r\nAs a university student, you&rsquo;ll be using laptops A LOT, and if you&rsquo;re using the internet to work and take notes, well, I hate to break it to you, but distractions are aplenty in your browser as well.\r\n\r\nMotion&rsquo;s free plan will block distracting sites like Facebook and YouTube. You&rsquo;ll also receive a report on how much of your time online is productive or distracted. ||\r\n\r\n\r\n || Cold Turkey ||\r\nMacOS, Windows (Works on all web browsers) || Free for Basic Plan\r\n\r\nIf you still find yourself getting distracted, this one&rsquo;s for you.

Cold Turkey will allow you to start a timer, during which distracting websites will be blocked entirely.\r\n\r\nUntil the timer stops, there&rsquo;s no way to unblock the sites and no turning back. You can even block the entire internet if you need to. Other apps have a way around website blocks, but not this one. Talk about tough love.\r\n\r\n \r\nManage your time\r\nYou&rsquo;ll be in charge of your own time in university, so it&rsquo;s important to stay on top of your schedule and things you need to do. If you never liked carrying a physical agenda around, give these apps a try. ||\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n|| Google Calendar ||\r\nWeb application, iOS, Android || Free\r\n\r\nGoogle Calendar is classic, simple, practical, and by far the most used app by all my peers. It allows you to organize all your classes, events, extracurriculars, and assignment deadlines across your phone and computer.\r\n\r\nWith its clean interface, you can easily see commitments throughout your day, week, and month. Set up reminders before events or for to-dos so you&rsquo;ll never forget anything. Say goodbye to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings, and hello to an organized student life!\r\n\r\n&quot;Google Calendar is the way to go!

(23, 'How To Make a Digital Mood Board', ' This is a guide on how to make an aesthetic digital mood board. Mood boards help me to visually express my ideas or a concept. I use them to guide my personal projects, to express creativity and also as content for my audience. The process of creating a mood board isn&rsquo;t linear - it can be back and forth of curating and editing. This process really helps to bring clarity to the concept you&rsquo;re trying to express. \r\nA mood board is a collage of visual ideas, ranging from photography, advertisements, logo designs, text, color guides, and other sources of information. Think of it as an inspiration board.\r\n\r\nWhat is a mood board made for?\r\n\r\nCollectively, mood boards define the style and tone of your project. They help team members and clients to understand your ideas in a visual way so that everyone can agree on certain elements from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nMood boards are used across a wide range of creative disciplines, but they are especially utilized in graphic and interior design, fashion, and advertising. Or you can just make them for fun!\r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s dive a little deeper into the advantages of a mood board:\r\n\r\nüåà Inspiration: Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to come up with new ideas. You might have been tasked with a project that&rsquo;s out of your comfort zone, or maybe you&rsquo;re just having an off-day. Either way, making a mood board will get those creative juices flowing, and soon enough, you&rsquo;ll have tons of ideas to present to your client!\r\n\r\n‚òÅÔ∏è A solid vision: It&rsquo;s not uncommon that you and a client verbally agree on a design concept, but you both visualize something completely different. Mood boards are a great representation of your design direction; to keep you, your team, and your client on the same wavelength.\r\n\r\nüí¨ Communication: It&rsquo;s important that you and your client are on the same page, and mood boards help you do that. Mood boards help represent your ideas in material form to a client, like a little glimpse into your design thoughts! Clients can give you constructive criticism from the get-go so that you don&rsquo;t waste time working on something that your client ends up turning down.', '1675606897eg-bright-moodyjpg.jpg', '2023-02-05 14:21:37', 3, 33, 0),

Your bedroom can be your personal sanctuary, a space to unwind and rejuvenate. In this blog post, we&#039;ll explore how to transform your bedroom into a haven for self-care.\r\n\r\n1.

A clutter-free environment can have a significant impact on your mental clarity and sense of calm.\r\n\r\n2. Calming Color Palette\r\n\r\nChoose a color palette that promotes tranquility. Soft, soothing colors like pastels, muted tones, or earthy hues work wonders in creating a serene atmosphere. Your bedroom&#039;s color scheme should resonate with your personal sense of peace.\r\n\r\n3. Bedding and Lighting\r\n\r\nInvest in high-quality bedding and linens for a plush and inviting bed. Layering with comfortable sheets, plump pillows, and warm blankets can make your bed the ultimate retreat. Lighting is equally important; opt for soft, warm lighting like bedside lamps or fairy lights to set the mood.\r\n\r\n4. Personalized Decor*\r\n\r\nPersonal touches make your space uniquely yours. Add custom art, decorative items, and meaningful memorabilia that reflect your personality and style. These touches not only enhance aesthetics but also create a deeper connection to your space.\r\n\r\n5.

Explore practical tips for organizing your clothes, accessories, and personal items efficiently. Incorporate storage solutions that balance functionality with aesthetics.\r\n\r\n6. Relaxation Nook\r\n\r\nConsider dedicating a corner of your bedroom to relaxation. Whether it&#039;s a cozy reading nook or a meditation space, having a designated area for self-care activities can enhance your daily routine and provide a peaceful escape.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn the end, a dreamy bedroom makeover is about nurturing your well-being. It&#039;s not just about aesthetics but creating an environment that supports self-care and inner peace. Transform your bedroom into a cozy retreat and discover the positive impact it can have on your life.\r\n\r\n', '1695462125my new vanity _3.jpg', '2023-09-23 09:42:05', 3, 34, 0);
